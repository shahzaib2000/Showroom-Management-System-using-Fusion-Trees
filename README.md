# Showroom-Management-System-using-Fusion-Trees

**Installing different modules**

You have to have pandas and kivy installed on the system to run our application. We need to follow some steps which are as follows:

**Step 1:**
Run Command Prompt in your PC

**Step 2:**
Run the following commands one by one and wait for them to install:

**pip install kivy**

**pip install pandas**


**Important Note:**

A point to note here is that we tested our application on the latest version of Python 3.9 but it does not work due to some Python library issues. Therefore, our application would work on the Python versions 3.8 or lower.
